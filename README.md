# Train Ticket Reservation System 

### About:
This project is about the Train-Ticket-Reservation-System which is used to view Train Schedule, search trains, Seat availability, Train timings. We can also enquire about fare of different trains. We can get information about train between two stations. We can book seats online. This provides a safe and secure seat reservation system.

### ========== Dummy Database Initialization ===========

STEP 1: Open SQL Plus OR SQL Developer

STEP 2: Login and connect to database using administrator username and password

STEP 3 :Execute the below command first to create a new user:

```SQL

ALTER SESSION SET "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=TRUE;  
CREATE USER RESERVATION IDENTIFIED BY MANAGER;
GRANT DBA TO RESERVATION;
COMMIT;

```
NOTE: If the above command fails for alter session issues, try to remove first line and then execute it.

STEP 4: Now execute the below sql query in same terminal

```SQL

CONNECT RESERVATION/MANAGER;
CREATE TABLE "RESERVATION"."CUSTOMER" 
(	
"MAILID" VARCHAR2(40) PRIMARY KEY, 
"PWORD" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL, 
"FNAME" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL, 
"LNAME" VARCHAR2(20), 
"ADDR" VARCHAR2(100), 
"PHNO" NUMBER(12) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "RESERVATION"."ADMIN"
(	
"MAILID" VARCHAR2(40) PRIMARY KEY, 
"PWORD" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL, 
"FNAME" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL, 
"LNAME" VARCHAR2(20), 
"ADDR" VARCHAR2(100), 
"PHNO" NUMBER(12) NOT NULL
);


CREATE TABLE "RESERVATION"."TRAIN" 
(	
"TR_NO" NUMBER(10) PRIMARY KEY, 
"TR_NAME" VARCHAR2(70) NOT NULL, 
"FROM_STN" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL, 
"TO_STN" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL, 
"SEATS" NUMBER(4) NOT NULL, 
"FARE" NUMBER(6,2) NOT NULL 
);

CREATE TABLE "RESERVATION"."HISTORY" 
(	
"TRANSID" VARCHAR2(36) PRIMARY KEY, 
"MAILID" VARCHAR2(40) REFERENCES "RESERVATION"."CUSTOMER"(MAILID), 
"TR_NO" NUMBER(10),
"DATE" DATE,
"FROM_STN" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL, 
"TO_STN" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL, 
"SEATS" NUMBER(3) NOT NULL, 
"AMOUNT" NUMBER(8,2) NOT NULL
);

COMMIT;

INSERT INTO RESERVATION.ADMIN VALUES('admin@demo.com','admin','System','Admin','Demo Address 123 colony','9874561230');


INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10001,'JODHPUR EXP','HOWRAH','JODHPUR', 152, 490.50);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10002,'YAMUNA EXP','GAYA','DELHI', 52, 550.50);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10003,'NILANCHAL EXP','GAYA','HOWRAH', 92, 451);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10004,'JAN SATABDI EXP','RANCHI','PATNA', 182, 550);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10005,'GANGE EXP','MUMBAI','KERALA', 12, 945);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10006,'GARIB RATH EXP','PATNA','DELHI', 1, 1450.75);



COMMIT;
```
STEP 5: Now Execute the below query one by one to check if the tables are created successfully
```SQL
SELECT * FROM ADMIN;
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER;
SELECT * FROM TRAIN;
SELECT * FROM HISTORY;

```
Note: If any of the above commands fails, please try to fix it first and then proceed to next step
